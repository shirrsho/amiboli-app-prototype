# Amiboli — Story-Based English Speaking App (Prototype)

A **mobile-first, visual-only** React prototype of **Amiboli**, a story-based English
speaking learning app with a playful, game-like (Duolingo-energy) feel.

> ⚠️ **This is a prototype.** No backend, no persistence, no real auth, no speech
> features. Everything is powered by hardcoded dummy data for one pre-logged-in
> user (Aarav). All state lives in memory and resets on refresh.

## ✨ What's inside

- **React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion** for animations (bouncy nodes, screen transitions, sheets, toasts)
- **React Router** (HashRouter — works inside a packaged APK)
- **PWA-ready** — manifest, icons, mobile viewport meta, theme color
- **Capacitor**-configured so you can package an Android APK later
- Locked to **360–430px** mobile width; on desktop it floats in a phone-sized frame

---

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`). The dev server also binds to
your LAN (`Network: http://192.168.x.x:5173`) so you can open it on a **real phone**
on the same Wi-Fi.

### Build (PWA-ready static site)

```bash
npm run build      # outputs to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
```

### Regenerate app icons (optional)

PNG icons are pre-generated in `public/icons/`. To rebuild them from the script:

```bash
npm run icons
```

---

## 🌐 Live demo (Vercel)

Deployed at **https://amiboli-app-prototype.vercel.app** — open it in Chrome on a
phone and **⋮ → Install app** for a true standalone PWA (full-screen, no address bar).

Redeploy after changes:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod   # from the project root (Vercel CLI, framework auto-detected)
```

> Why a real host matters for mobile install: Android builds a **WebAPK** by
> having Google's servers fetch your manifest + icons. That works over a clean
> HTTPS origin (Vercel), but **not** through `localhost`/LAN-IP `http://` or an
> ngrok-free tunnel (its interstitial warning page blocks that server-side
> fetch, so you only get a browser shortcut *with* an address bar). Desktop
> install works from `localhost` because it doesn't use WebAPK minting.

## ⬇️ "Download" button — install as a PWA

There's a **Download** button in two places:

- a floating pill on **Home** (bottom-right), and
- a **Download app** row at the top of **Settings**.

Tapping it installs Amiboli as a **PWA** (Add to Home Screen) so it runs
full-screen like a native app:

- **Chrome / Edge / Android** — fires the browser's one-tap install prompt
  (captured via `beforeinstallprompt`).
- **iOS Safari / desktop / not-yet-eligible** — opens a short sheet with the
  manual "Add to Home Screen" steps.
- **Already installed** — shows an "App already installed" toast.

This is powered by a small service worker ([`public/sw.js`](public/sw.js)) +
the web manifest. The service worker **only registers in production builds**
(it would interfere with Vite's dev HMR), so to see the real install prompt
locally, run the production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview      # then open the printed localhost URL in Chrome
```

> The service worker caches the static app shell for offline launch only — it
> does **not** persist any user/dummy data (app state still resets on refresh).
>
> Note: the **Download button installs the PWA; it does not download an `.apk`
> file.** Producing an installable `.apk` requires the Android toolchain — see
> the Capacitor APK steps below.

## 📱 App flow

```
Splash (auto-advances ~2s)
  → Home (the dummy user is treated as already logged in)

Onboarding (3 swipeable slides) and Auth (UI only) are reachable but skippable:
  Onboarding  →  #/onboarding
  Auth        →  #/auth      (any "Continue" tap → Home, no validation)
```

The main app is a **5-tab bottom bar**: **Home · Leaderboard · Profile · Plans · Settings**.

### Screens

| Screen          | Highlights                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Home**        | Winding, path-based story map grouped by Books; current chapter glows with a "Continue" pill; locked books collapse. Top bar has streak/energy/bell/avatar. Bell opens a notifications sheet. |
| **Leaderboard** | Pinned "my rank" card, filter chips (Avg/Total/Clarity/Grammar/Smoothness/Relevance) that re-sort the list, top-3 medals, user row highlighted. |
| **Profile**     | Avatar, streak + weekly calendar, stats grid, skill bars, **Strengths / Areas to grow / coach-style suggestions**. |
| **Plans**       | Free (energy-based) current plan, attractive gradient Pro card ("MOST POPULAR"), Free-vs-Pro comparison table. |
| **Settings**    | Account, notification & sound toggles (UI only), language, legal rows, log out → Auth, app version. |

> **Chapters are not playable.** Tapping any chapter only bounces + shows a toast
> ("Story mode coming soon"). All real actions (Upgrade, Logout, Google auth,
> Edit info) are non-functional or show toasts.

### 🎯 Where the dummy data lives

**Everything is in [`src/data/dummyData.js`](src/data/dummyData.js).** Tweak names,
scores, books, chapters, leaderboard, plans, and notifications there — no other
file needs to change. Key exports:

- `user` — the active (pre-logged-in) user: Aarav, energy, streak, scores, rank
- `books` — the story map (Books → Chapters, with `status` + `score`)
- `leaderboardUsers` / `leaderboardFilters` — precomputed per-filter scores
- `strengths` / `weaknesses` / `suggestions` — Profile coaching content
- `plans` — Free vs Pro details + comparison table
- `notifications` — bell-sheet items
- `skills`, `appVersion`

Data is kept **internally consistent**: Book 1 (3 completed) + Book 2 chapters 1–4
(4 completed) = **7 chapters completed**, matching the profile/stats. Aarav's
skill scores (82/64/78/88) average to **78** and place him at **rank #14**.

## 🤖 Building the Android APK (Capacitor)

Capacitor is already configured (`capacitor.config.json`, `appId: com.amiboli.app`,
`webDir: dist`). Follow these exact steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** installed (with Android SDK + a configured emulator or device)
- **JDK 17** (bundled with recent Android Studio)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install deps (if you haven't already)
npm install

# 2. Build the web app — Capacitor copies from dist/
npm run build

# 3. Add the native Android project (creates ./android, one-time)
npx cap add android

# 4. Sync the built web assets + config into the native project
npx cap sync

# 5. Open the project in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

Then **in Android Studio**:

1. Let Gradle finish syncing.
2. **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**.
3. When the build finishes, click **locate** in the notification — the debug APK is at:
   `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
4. Install on a device: enable USB debugging, then either drag the APK onto an
   emulator, or run `adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

> 🔁 **After any web change**, re-run `npm run build && npx cap sync` before
> rebuilding in Android Studio so the native project picks up the new `dist/`.

### Release APK (optional)

For a signed release build, in Android Studio use **Build → Generate Signed
Bundle / APK**, create/select a keystore, and choose **release**. Output lands in
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`.

---

## 🎨 Design language

- Warm, energetic palette (orange-led) defined in `tailwind.config.js`
- One **display** font (Baloo 2) + one **body** font (Nunito), loaded in `index.html`
- Rounded shapes, soft shadows, press/scale feedback on every tappable element
- Smooth screen transitions, glowing/pulsing current chapter, animated progress bars

---

## 🧱 Hard constraints (by design)

- ❌ No `localStorage`, no backend, no API calls — all state in memory, resets on refresh
- ❌ Chapters are not playable (tap = bounce + toast only)
- ❌ Upgrade / Logout / Google auth / Edit info are non-functional (toasts or route only)
- ✅ All tweakable data centralized in `src/data/dummyData.js`
